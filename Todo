/*
The three core concept in redux.
Store :That holds the state of your application.
Action : That describes the changes in the state of the application.

Reducer : Which actually carries out the state transition depending on the action.

The three principle in redux
principle one: The state of ur whole application is stored in an object tree within single store.
Principle Two: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happend.
Princple Three : To specify how the state is transformed by actions, u write pure reducers.
